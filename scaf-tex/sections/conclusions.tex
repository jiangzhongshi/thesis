\section{Limitations and Remarks}

We proposed a simple and robust algorithm to generate bijective maps, both in 2D and 3D. We demonstrated the practical value of the algorithm in UV mapping and deformation applications, and its robustness with extensive stress tests.

One major venue for future work is the support of hard positional constraints, which are favored over soft constraints in many practical applications. Our current algorithm only supports soft constraints as geometric energy \cite{Schuller:2013}. To support hard constraints we would need to generate a bijective starting point that guarantees those constraints, and then preserve them in our optimization. While bijecive maps with hard constraints can be constructed for a 2D patch homeomorphic to a disk \cite{Weber:2014:LIP} and for a 3D volume homeomorphic to a ball \cite{Campen:2016}, the generic solution is still elusive.

In 3D cases, the generation of the initial scaffold is not as robust as in 2D, since TetGen fails for geometries with numerical challenges (Chapter~\ref{chp:curve} provides a comparison and a robust alternative). 
Our algorithm is also slower in 3D due to larger and denser linear systems, as well as the need for local mesh refinement operations instead of regenerating the entire tetrahedralization. A more optimized and parallel implementation could reduce this overhead, as we present in Chapter~\ref*{chp:wmtk}
