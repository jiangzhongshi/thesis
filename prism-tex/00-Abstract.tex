We introduce an algorithm to convert a self-intersection free, orientable, and manifold triangle mesh $\T$ into a \emph{generalized prismatic shell} equipped with a bijective projection operator to map $\T$ to \revision{a class of} discrete surfaces contained within the shell whose normals satisfy a simple local condition. Properties can be robustly and efficiently transferred between these surfaces using the prismatic layer as a common parametrization domain. %The bijective projection can be calculated \emph{exactly} in rational arithmetic and with a very low error in floating-point.

The combination of the prismatic shell construction and corresponding projection operator is a robust building block readily usable in many downstream applications, including the solution of PDEs, displacement maps synthesis, Boolean operations, tetrahedral meshing, geometric textures, and nested cages.
