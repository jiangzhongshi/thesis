\section{Variants}
\subsection{Pointless Variant}
We extend the framework by allowing the relaxation of the definition of a section. 
Originally, any intersection between the triangle and the (different decomposition of the) prism is counted. Here, we explicitly forgive when the intersection is only one point on the vertex of mid surface and the triangle. 
This predicate can be easily implemented, making use of the bitwise equal coordinates.
Therefore, the initial tracking section only follows the edge-adjacency relationship, instead of the vertex adjacent one in the main text. 
With such adjusted condition for section, the optimization can be trivially accomodated. The only thing that is different (simpler) is the part for bevel, since we have less triangles to consider.
The existing one is still valid, however, we can get away with a simpler red-green intersection

\subsection{Dynamic Intersection Check}
To make it easier to guarantee a self-intersection-free shell, we substitute the AABB tree collision check with a dynamic hash grid. We initialize two hash grids at the beginning, one for the top surface and another one for the bottom surface. This is followed by additional shrinking to make sure they are clear. Each local opeartion is responsible to trial and keep the validity of the surfaces. Furthermore, the top/bottom surface should not interfere with the reference input surface, this can be accelerated through the maintainance of the tracking list, and is trial checked before a local operation is performed.
