As I have the privilege to finish my thesis in my home during an unusual global pandemic, I want to first thank all front-line healthcare and essential workers worldwide.

I am thankful to so many advisors and mentors: Daniele has provided constant support over the years, guiding me through each small step (from debugging together to revising whiteboard drawings) to grow from a fresh college graduate to a researcher with some expertise and experience; thank you for being the most patient and caring mentor and friend. 
And Denis, thanks for teaching me to judge good research and mathematical rigor, also being an academic role model over the years. 
Teseo, for always listening and participating in my constant debate, from tiny details to larger directions, at any time of the day.
I would also express my gratitude to the committee members of this thesis: I am grateful to have you safeguarding the milestone and directions of my Ph.D. studies, thanks Ken also from the qualification exam, and championing the future of realities; and thanks Georg for guarding my thesis proposal and defense, as well as offering thoughtful guidance on scientific computing directions which was helpful through the final chapters of my Ph.D. studies.

I am lucky to have so many academic collaborators from whom I learn. Not every interaction results in a research project, and not every project yields a visible output. Still, each encounter impacts how I move forward, and this thesis wouldn't be the same without all the teaching from everyone:
Ligang for leading me to the fascinating field of computer graphics, and especially geometry processing;
Scott for helping me through the very first project in my research journey;
Joan and Ilya for teaching me some of the fundamental theories in learning;
Anna, Albert, Francis, Alexey, Evgeny, and Marc for the great collaboration on producing the large dataset;
Junior, Tiantian, and Ladislav for teaching me physics-based animation;
Minjie, Lingfan, and Jinyang for setting a good taste in systems design;
Davi, Julian, Chase, and Zach for getting my hands dirty on 3D printing and laser cutting machines and seeing how digital can be connected to tangible gadgets;
Jeremie, Qingnan, and Xifeng for participating in various discussions and having a long-lasting impact on my career;
Hanxiao for walking through the realm of parameterization together;
Yixin for establishing the caliber in the lab and showing me about tetrahedral meshes;
Ziyi, YunFan, and Jiacheng for helping me through the finishing lines of the research and have the torch of knowledge and study passing on;
Vova for introducing me to the realm of computer vision and continued support during the year-long internship and collaboration;
Suraj for providing a challenging academic problem in the industry setting and supporting me in getting closer to applications;
Bolun, Zizhou, Leyi, Siqi, Arvi, Ryan, Matt, and Francisca for getting me to 1know all different areas in graphics and computer science, as well as technical/academic support over the years; and Wenjun, Yueteng, Yishuai, Wenshuo, Han, Cheng, Yixin Tao for walking through the Ph.D. journey together and be the solid support for each other.

I would also like to thank Shenglong, Hong, and other staff at NYU, who offered significant assistance with research and life resources. And thank various agencies and institutions for partially sponsoring this research: New York University, National Science Foundation, Adobe, nTopology, and Advanced Micro Devices.

Finally, I would like to thank my parents, Rong and Chaohui, for instilling scientific values early on and supporting and believing in my choices on the other side of the globe.
And Run, my muse and inspiration: thank you for supporting me through my long working hours and bringing colors into our home and life.
