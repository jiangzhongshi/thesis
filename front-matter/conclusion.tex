\section{Future Directions}
Geometry + Simulations

Geometry + Vision construction

Finally, the availability of data is essential to algorithm verification and data-driven algorithm development. In collaboration with OnShape Inc. and colleagues at NYU, we collected and curated large-scale computed-aided design (CAD) models created by mechanical engineers. The dataset contains one million geometry shapes with rich information. 
%The dataset is publicly online, and the result is presented in “A Big CAD Model Dataset For Geometric Deep Learning,” Koch et al., CVPR, 2019. 
Physical simulation on a large scale of datasets allows for machine learning techniques to take advantage, in order to assist the generative design or practical simulations.
