In this dissertation, we have examined problems with meshes, and mappings. By robust association of attributes between different representations, our constructions have benefit robust geometric modeling and scalable physical simulation.

However, there are still much to be done.

Fast boolean.

This chapter relates to the outlook and conclusions.

Bijective Parameterization has received follow ups.

Geometry + Simulations

Geometry + Vision construction

Finally, the availability of data is essential to algorithm verification and data-driven algorithm development. In collaboration with OnShape Inc. and colleagues at NYU, we collected and curated large-scale computed-aided design (CAD) models created by mechanical engineers. The dataset contains one million geometry shapes with rich information. 
%The dataset is publicly online, and the result is presented in “A Big CAD Model Dataset For Geometric Deep Learning,” Koch et al., CVPR, 2019. 
Physical simulation on a large scale of datasets allows for machine learning techniques to take advantage, in order to assist the generative design or practical simulations.
