Mathematical Contributions:

Algorithmic contributions:
Robust algorithms through experimental and theory.

Educational:
auxiliary line or helping line is a useful tool in elementry geometry proofs. It is usually overlooked in more advanced textbooks. However, as I have showcased in several applications, educations with such tools would make sense computationally.

Outreach and impact:
