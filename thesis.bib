It proves that when the boundary of the domain is piecewise analytic, boundary conditions are piecewise analytic, and the sides of the elements are analytic, the h-p version has an exponential rate of convergence. Numerical computations are included. The paper generalizes the results previously obtained by the authors [The h-p version of finite element method, Part 1: The basic approximation results, Comp. Mech., 1 (1986), pp. 21-41], [The h-p version of finite element method, Part 2: General results and applications, Comp. Mech., 1 (1986), pp. 203-220].},

  abstract   = {Field-guided parameterization methods have proven effective for quad meshing of surfaces; these methods compute smooth cross fields to guide the meshing process and then integrate the fields to construct a discrete mesh. A key challenge in extending these methods to three dimensions, however, is representation of field values. Whereas cross fields can be represented by tangent vector fields that form a linear space, the 3D analog—an octahedral frame field—takes values in a nonlinear manifold. In this work, we describe the space of octahedral frames in the language of differential and algebraic geometry. With this understanding, we develop geometry-aware tools for optimization of octahedral fields, namely geodesic stepping and exact projection via semidefinite relaxation. Our algebraic approach not only provides an elegant and mathematically sound description of the space of octahedral frames but also suggests a generalization to frames whose three axes scale independently, better capturing the singular behavior we expect to see in volumetric frame fields. These new odeco frames, so called as they are represented by orthogonally decomposable tensors, also admit a semidefinite program–based projection operator. Our description of the spaces of octahedral and odeco frames suggests computing frame fields via manifold-based optimization algorithms; we show that these algorithms efficiently produce high-quality fields while maintaining stability and smoothness.},

  abstract   = {We introduce the notion of harmonic triangulations: a harmonic triangulation simultaneously minimizes the Dirichlet energy of all piecewise linear functions. By a famous result of Rippa, Delaunay triangulations are the harmonic triangulations of planar point sets. We prove by explicit counterexample that in 3D a harmonic triangulation does not exist in general. However, we show that bistellar flips are harmonic: if they decrease Dirichlet energy for one set of function values, they do so for all. This observation gives rise to the notion of locally harmonic triangulations. We demonstrate that locally harmonic triangulations can be efficiently computed, and efficiently reduce sliver tetrahedra. The notion of harmonic triangulation also gives rise to a scalar measure of the quality of a triangulation, which can be used to prioritize flips and optimize the position of vertices. Tetrahedral meshes generated by optimizing this function generally show better quality than Delaunay-based optimization techniques.},

Inspired by the use of cross field in quad meshing and the CubeCover approach in hex meshing, we present a complete all-hex meshing framework based on singularity-restricted field that is essential to induce a valid all-hex structure. Given a volume represented by a tetrahedral mesh, we first compute a boundary-aligned 3D frame field inside it, then convert the frame field to be singularity-restricted by our effective topological operations. In our all-hex meshing framework, we apply the CubeCover method to achieve the volume parametrization. For reducing degenerate elements appearing in the volume parametrization, we also propose novel tetrahedral split operations to preprocess singularity-restricted frame fields. Experimental results show that our algorithm generates high-quality all-hex meshes from a variety of 3D volumes robustly and efficiently.},

The AHF extends the compact array-based half-edge and half-face data structures (T. J. Alumbaugh and X. Jiao, Compact array-based mesh data structures, IMR, 2005) to support mixed-dimensional and non-manifold meshes. The design goals of our data structure include generality to support such meshes, efficiency of neighborhood queries and mesh modification, compactness of memory footprint, and facilitation of interoperability of mesh-based application codes. To accomplish these goals, our data structure uses sibling half-facets as a core abstraction, coupled with other explicit and implicit representations of entities. A unique feature of our data structure is a comprehensive implementation in MATLAB, which allows rapid prototyping, debugging, testing, and deployment of meshing algorithms and other mesh-based numerical methods. We have also developed a C++ implementation built on top of MOAB (T.J. Tautges, R. Meyers, and K. Merkley, MOAB: A Mesh-Oriented Database, Sandia National Laboratories, 2004). We present some comparisons of the memory requirements and computational costs, and also demonstrate its effectiveness with a few sample applications.},

abstract = {The following problem is discussed: given n points in the plane (the sites) and an arbitrary query point q, find the site that is closest to q. This problem can be solved by constructing the Voronoi diagram of the griven sites and then locating the query point inone of its regions. Two algorithms are given, one that constructs the Voronoi diagram in O(n log n) time, and another that inserts a new sit on O(n) time. Both are based on the use of the Voronoi dual, or Delaunay triangulation, and are simple enough to be of practical value. the simplicity of both algorithms can be attributed to the separation of the geometrical and topological aspects of the problem and to the use of two simple but powerful primitives,  a geometric predicate and an operator for manipulating the topology of the diagram. The topology is represented by a new data structure for generalized diagrams, that is, embeddings of graphs in two-dimensional manifolds. This structure represents simultaneously an embedding, its dual, and its mirror image. Furthermore, just two operators are sufficients for building and modifying arbitrary diagrams.},

It is shown that there exists a large amount of ordering information in subdivided manifolds: given a (k-2)-cell in the boundary of a (k+1)-cell, 1 ≤ k ≤ d, all of the k- and (k-1)-cells 'between them' can be ordered 'around' the (k-2)-cell. This includes the usual orderings in 2- and 3-dimensional objects. We introduce the 'cell-tuple structure', a simple, uniform representation of the incidence and ordering information in a subdivided manifold. It includes the quad-edge data structure of Guibas and Stolfi [GS 85] and the facet-edge data structure of Dobkin and Laszlo [DL 87] as special cases in dimensions 2 and 3, respectively.},

  abstract = {With increased complexity of geometric data, topological models play an increasingly important role beyond boundary representations, assemblies, finite elements, image processing, and other traditional modeling applications. While many graph- and index-based data structures have been proposed, no standard representation has emerged as of now. Furthermore, such representations typically do not deal with representations of mappings and functions and do not scale to support parallel processing, open source, and client-based architectures. We advocate that a proper mathematical model for all topological structures is a (co)chain complex: a sequence of (co)chain spaces and (co)boundary mappings. This in turn implies all topological structures may be represented by a collection of sparse matrices. We propose a Linear Algebraic Representation (LAR) scheme for mod 2 (co)chain complexes using CSR matrices and show that it supports a variety of topological computations using standard matrix algebra, without any overhead in space or running time. A full open source implementation of LAR is available and is being used for a variety of applications.},

abstract = {A key advantage of working with structured grids e.g., images is the ability to directly tap into the powerful machinery of linear algebra. This is not much so for unstructured grids where intermediate bookkeeping data structures stand in the way. On modern high performance computing hardware, the conventional wisdom behind these intermediate structures is further challenged by costly memory access, and more importantly by prohibitive memory resources on environments such as graphics hardware. In this paper, we bypass this problem by introducing a sparse matrix representation for unstructured grids which not only reduces the memory storage requirements but also cuts down on the bulk of data movement from global storage to the compute units. In order to take full advantage of the proposed representation, we augment ordinary matrix multiplication by means of action maps, local maps which encode the desired interaction between grid vertices. In this way, geometric computations and topological modifications translate into concise linear algebra operations. In our algorithmic formulation, we capitalize on the nature of sparse matrix-vector multiplication which allows avoiding explicit transpose computation and storage. Furthermore, we develop an efficient vectorization to the demanding assembly process of standard graph and finite element matrices.},

abstract = {We propose a new static high-performance mesh data structure for triangle surface meshes on the GPU. Our data structure is carefully designed for parallel execution while capturing mesh locality and confining data access, as much as possible, within the GPU's fast "shared memory." We achieve this by subdividing the mesh into patches and representing these patches compactly using a matrix-based representation. Our patching technique is decorated with ribbons, thin mesh strips around patches that eliminate the need to communicate between different computation thread blocks, resulting in consistent high throughput. We call our data structure RXMesh: Ribbon-matriX Mesh. We hide the complexity of our data structure behind a flexible but powerful programming model that helps deliver high performance by inducing load balance even in highly irregular input meshes. We show the efficacy of our programming model on common geometry processing applications---mesh smoothing and filtering, geodesic distance, and vertex normal computation. For evaluation, we benchmark our data structure against well-optimized GPU and (single and multi-core) CPU data structures and show significant speedups.},

  abstract   = {We present a data structure that makes it easy to run a large class of algorithms from computational geometry and scientific computing on extremely poor-quality surface meshes. Rather than changing the geometry, as in traditional remeshing, we consider intrinsic triangulations which connect vertices by straight paths along the exact geometry of the input mesh. Our key insight is that such a triangulation can be encoded implicitly by storing the direction and distance to neighboring vertices. The resulting signpost data structure then allows geometric and topological queries to be made on-demand by tracing paths across the surface. Existing algorithms can be easily translated into the intrinsic setting, since this data structure supports the same basic operations as an ordinary triangle mesh (vertex insertions, edge splits, etc.). The output of intrinsic algorithms can then be stored on an ordinary mesh for subsequent use; unlike previous data structures, we use a constant amount of memory and do not need to explicitly construct an overlay mesh unless it is specifically requested. Working in the intrinsic setting incurs little computational overhead, yet we can run algorithms on extremely degenerate inputs, including all manifold meshes from the Thingi10k data set. To evaluate our data structure we implement several fundamental geometric algorithms including intrinsic versions of Delaunay refinement and optimal Delaunay triangulation, approximation of Steiner trees, adaptive mesh refinement for PDEs, and computation of Poisson equations, geodesic distance, and flip-free tangent vector fields.},

  abstract   = {We describe an efficient algorithm to compute a discrete metric with prescribed Gaussian curvature at all interior vertices and prescribed geodesic curvature along the boundary of a mesh. The metric is (discretely) conformally equivalent to the input metric. Its construction is based on theory developed in [Gu et al. 2018b] and [Springborn 2020], relying on results on hyperbolic ideal Delaunay triangulations. Generality is achieved by considering the surface's intrinsic triangulation as a degree of freedom, and particular attention is paid to the proper treatment of surface boundaries. While via a double cover approach the case with boundary can be reduced to the case without boundary quite naturally, the implied symmetry of the setting causes additional challenges related to stable Delaunay-critical configurations that we address explicitly. We furthermore explore the numerical limits of the approach and derive continuous maps from the discrete metrics.},

Several implementation issues are discussed, including the choice of triangulation algorithms and data structures, the effect of several variants of the Delaunay refinement algorithm on mesh quality, and the use of adaptive exact arithmetic to ensure robustness with minimal sacrifice of speed. The problem of triangulating a planar straight line graph (PSLG) without introducing new small angles is shown to be impossible for some PSLGs, contradicting the claim that a variant of the Delaunay refinement algorithm solves this problem.},

  abstract  = {Many applications in computer graphics and related fields can benefit from automatic simplification of complex polygonal surface models. Applications are often confronted with either very densely over-sampled surfaces or models too complex for the limited available hardware capacity. An effective algorithm for rapidly producing high-quality approximations of the original model is a valuable tool for managing data complexity. In this dissertation, I present my simplification algorithm, based on iterative vertex pair contraction. This technique provides an effective compromise between the fastest algorithms, which often produce poor quality results, and the highest-quality algorithms, which are generally very slow. For example, a 1000 face approximation of a 100,000 face model can be produced in about 10 seconds on a PentiumPro 200. The algorithm can simplify both the geometry and topology of manifold as well as non-manifold surfaces. In addition to producing single approximations, my algorithm can also be used to generate multiresolution representations such as progressive meshes and vertex hierarchies for view-dependent refinement. The foundation of my simplification algorithm, is the quadric error metric which I have developed. It provides a useful and economical characterization of local surface shape, and I have proven a direct mathematical connection between the quadric metric and surface curvature. A generalized form of this metric can accommodate surfaces with material properties, such as RGB color or texture coordinates. I have also developed a closely related technique for constructing a hierarchy of well-defined surface regions composed of disjoint sets of faces. This algorithm involves applying a dual form of my simplification algorithm to the dual graph of the input surface. The resulting structure is a hierarchy of face clusters which is an effective multiresolution representation for applications such as radiosity.},

  abstract   = {Solid shapes in computer graphics are often represented with boundary descriptions, e.g. triangle meshes, but animation, physically-based simulation, and geometry processing are more realistic and accurate when explicit volume representations are available. Tetrahedral meshes which exactly contain (interpolate) the input boundary description are desirable but difficult to construct for a large class of input meshes. Character meshes and CAD models are often composed of many connected components with numerous self-intersections, non-manifold pieces, and open boundaries, precluding existing meshing algorithms. We propose an automatic algorithm handling all of these issues, resulting in a compact discretization of the input's inner volume. We only require reasonably consistent orientation of the input triangle mesh. By generalizing the winding number for arbitrary triangle meshes, we define a function that is a perfect segmentation for watertight input and is well-behaved otherwise. This function guides a graphcut segmentation of a constrained Delaunay tessellation (CDT), providing a minimal description that meets the boundary exactly and may be fed as input to existing tools to achieve element quality. We highlight our robustness on a number of examples and show applications of solving PDEs, volumetric texturing and elastic simulation.},

  abstract   = {Bijective maps are commonly used in many computer graphics and scientific computing applications, including texture, displacement, and bump mapping. However, their computation is numerically challenging due to the global nature of the problem, which makes standard smooth optimization techniques prohibitively expensive. We propose to use a scaffold structure to reduce this challenging and global problem to a local injectivity condition. This construction allows us to benefit from the recent advancements in locally injective maps optimization to efficiently compute large scale bijective maps (both in 2D and 3D), sidestepping the need to explicitly detect and avoid collisions. Our algorithm is guaranteed to robustly compute a globally bijective map, both in 2D and 3D. To demonstrate the practical applicability, we use it to compute globally bijective single patch parametrizations, to pack multiple charts into a single UV domain, to remove self-intersections from existing models, and to deform 3D objects while preventing self-intersections. Our approach is simple to implement, efficient (two orders of magnitude faster than competing methods), and robust, as we demonstrate in a stress test on a parametrization dataset with over a hundred meshes.},
